Roam Research allows you to upload and render pdfs, but until now you couldn't do that for DOCX files. You can with this extension.

Drag, paste or `/upload` a docx file into your graph and the extension will recognise the file, and render it in place.

If your document is more than one page long, the docx previewer will try to paginate and show buttons as below.

If your document is a single page the buttons will not appear.

With many thanks to [@dvargas92495](https://github.com/dvargas92495) and [@mdroidian](https://github.com/mdroidian) for their brilliant work and community contribution of https://github.com/RoamJS/roamjs-components. None of my extensions that use react components would be possible without their generosity.

**Limitations:**
- this extension allows you to preview docx files, but not edit them. AFAIK there are no nodejs packages that will render a docx file in React that would allow editing to occur.
